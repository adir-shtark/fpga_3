2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin mux_o/decide_m_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) OV7670_SIOD direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (OV7670_SIOD) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on OV7670_D[0] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of OV7670_PCLK.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on OV7670_D[1] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of OV7670_PCLK.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on OV7670_D[2] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of OV7670_PCLK.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on OV7670_D[3] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of OV7670_PCLK.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on OV7670_D[4] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of OV7670_PCLK.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on OV7670_D[5] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of OV7670_PCLK.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on OV7670_D[6] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of OV7670_PCLK.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on OV7670_D[7] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of OV7670_PCLK.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#9 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on OV7670_HREF relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of OV7670_PCLK.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#10 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on OV7670_VSYNC relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of OV7670_PCLK.
Related violations: <none>
